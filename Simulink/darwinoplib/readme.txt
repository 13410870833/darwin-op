This directory and its subdirectories contain Matlab code and Simulink libraries to communicate with the DarwinOP humanoid robot.

At this time, only the "Software In Loop (SIL)" mode is supported and the robot must execute the program /darwin/Linux/project/instrumentation/instrumentation from the darwinop-ens repository located at https://github.com/darwinop-ens/darwin-op

This project is still under heavy development and might support embedded development "Hardware In Loop" (HIL) in the future.
